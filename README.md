# Vimeo Video Demo App

## Description

This is a demo app that collects videos (currently set to music) from the Vimeo API and displays them in a RecyclerView. The app consists of two parts:

1. **Regular XML App**: A traditional Android app using XML-based UI.
2. **Compose App**: An Android app using Jetpack Compose for UI.

## Functionality

The app provides the following functionalities:

- **Automatic Loading**: The app automatically loads 20 videos on the first launch.
- **Lazy Loading**: Additional videos are loaded when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a video opens a detailed description of it and simultaneously opens a player.
- **Two App Versions**: The app has both traditional XML-based UI and Jetpack Compose-based UI.

## Swapping Between Apps

To swap between the two versions of the app, press the floating action button.
